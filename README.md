# portfolio
Currently working on a personal website to showcase skills I learned in and outside of classes. You can consider this to be a project portfolio which will shift to being something more robust. 
Future Adds:
An about me page to provide to showcase who I am and what I value
Adding a blog to be a part of my website where I will review products I use.
